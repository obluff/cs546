        <h2> South Shore Charter Public School </h2>
        <p>
          Ahh charter schools, the injection of the market into our public school system. School choice, an embodiment of the neoliberal ethos,
          garners a lot of admittedly fair criticism. However, in my case it provided a chill, diverse, progressive alternative to to the low performing
          schools in my district. It was odd at some times but my time there was reasonable.
